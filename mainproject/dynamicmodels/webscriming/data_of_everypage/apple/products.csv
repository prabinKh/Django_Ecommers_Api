The new Wide camera captures 47 percent more light for better pictures and movies. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization keeps your photographs steady even when you aren't present. It's the biggest dual-camera system ever – with its widest Wide camera sensor. Cinematic Shoots Filmmakers use a technique called rack focus, which includes switching emphasis from one subject to another, to guide the audience's attention in their films. You can now easily apply the same narrative approach in your iPhone movies. Focus Simply start recording, and Cinematic mode will keep your subject in focus while creating a beautiful depth-of-field effect all around them. When an important new topic enters the scene, the cinematic mode may identify it and alter the emphasis accordingly. You may now easily create films that seem and feel like they're from a movie. Dolby Vision HDR Smart HDR 4 can identify and modify the contrast, lighting, and skin tones for up to four people in a picture. Night mode automatically detects low-light scenarios and adjusts to shoot bright, sharp images. In Portrait mode, the background is blurred to help you focus on your subject. Ultra-Wide camera In low- to mid-light conditions, Deep Fusion is active. It analyzes many exposures pixel by pixel to capture the most delicate textures, patterns, and characteristics. The Ultra Broad camera gives you a broad field of vision even when you're near to what you're shooting. As a consequence, you'll be able to see more of the action without taking a step back. Reminder Memories are auto-generated slideshows composed of unforgettable images from your photo library. Make them your own by adding your own style and mood, as well as a soundtrack from your music library.

Super Retina XDR display Brightness Our OLED display brightens by 28%, reaching 800 nits, making it easier to see in strong sunlight. It still goes up to 1200 nits for HDR content. Bright whites, true blacks, and everything shades in between will pop. Despite this, the display consumes less energy than it has in the past. Colorful The iPhone 13 includes a cinema-standard wide color gamut, which displays colors exactly as filmmakers intended. Because of the great color integrity, everything on the screen appears to be extremely real. Sharper Photographs, videos, and text — whatever you're looking at — seem extra-sharp thanks to the Super Retina XDR display's high pixel density. The display is also larger due to a smaller TrueDepth camera area. A15 Bionic The A15 Bionic is responsible for the breakneck speed Cinematic mode, Photographic Styles, Live Text, and more. Its Secure Enclave safeguards personal information including Face ID data and contacts. It's also more efficient, which means the battery lasts longer. A CPU that is up to 50% faster than the competition. Graphics that are up to 30% faster than those of the competition. The iPhone 13 Pro is the only smartphone with a faster CPU. Touch in a moment FaceTime on iOS 15 allows you to continue a chat while watching movies, listening to music, or doing anything else on your device.
