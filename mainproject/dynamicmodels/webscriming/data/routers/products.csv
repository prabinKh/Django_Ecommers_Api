High-Performance CPU and Antennas Powerful Dual-Core CPU ensures smooth 4K UHD streaming to Smart TVs, mobile devices and gaming consoles without buffering. 4x5dBi High gain antennas boost the sensitivity of the WiFi router, create connections over greater distances, providing powerful penetration through walls.   Built-in VPN Clients With built-in PPTP / L2TP VPN Clients, this router can easily establish a connection to VPN Server to transport all your online data and traffic, securing it with its encryption at the same time. You can use this function to connect your home network with your work network or school network. You only need to configure the router once, and all the devices in the network can be connected. Greatly facilitate your work, study and life.  20+ DDNS Support When you apply for an Internet package from an operator, the operator will usually assign you an IP at random. A random and frequently changing IP cannot be used to remotely manage home networks and equipment. You can bind your home IP address to a custom domain name through the DDNS function. No matter how the IP changes, the domain name can point to your network, which makes remote management possible.  OpenWrt Ready 16MB Flash and 128MB DDR3 ensure the continuous operation of the operating system, makes the router runs faster and provides more possibilities for function expansion. And as bing built with such large flash and DDR, WR2100 makes it possible to install OpenWrt system. You can get related software from Cudy official website.
