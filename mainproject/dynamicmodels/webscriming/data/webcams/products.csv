Additionally, Rally Camera provides premium results in professional meeting spaces of all shapes and sizes. Thanks to its advanced lenses and innovative technologies. EXCEPTIONAL VERSATILITY With whisper-quiet mechanical Pan/Tilt/Zoom, razor-sharp 15X HD zoom, expansive 90° diagonal field of view, and powerful 4K sensor, Rally Camera captures every person in the room with the truly phenomenal video quality. STUDIO-QUALITY VIDEO With an Ultra-HD imaging system, Rally Camera delivers brilliantly sharp video, outstanding color, and exceptional optical accuracy at resolutions up to 4K. Furthermore, Logitech RightLight™ technology optimizes light balance to emphasize faces and render natural-looking skin tones, even in dim or backlit conditions. SLEEK INDUSTRIAL DESIGN Rally Camera incorporates world-class Logitech optics and 4K sensor in a premium industrial design suitable for any professional setting. Also, Elegantly finished in matte black with slate gray metal trim, the Logitech Rally Camera can be positioned on a table, mounted on a tripod, or secured to a wall with included hardware.

In addition, RightLight™ optimizes light balance and priorities faces over objects and surfaces to render natural-looking skin tones. Plus, Rally Camera is compatible with virtually any video conferencing app right out of the box. PRIVACY ASSURANCE When the Logitech Rally Camera is not in use, the lens defaults to a parked position where the lens is pointed straight down. Moreover, this provides visual affirmation that the camera is unable to “see” anything in the meeting space when idle. The lens lifts to a preset position when joining a meeting and parks automatically when the meeting ends. In addition, whenever the video is on a mute during a meeting, a status light illuminates red to affirm visual privacy. AUTOMATIC CAMERA CONTROL Logitech RightSight camera control technology automatically moves and adjusts the lens to comfortably frame all the meeting participants. Enjoy hands-free convenience or take manual control: participants are always in view and optimally pictured on-screen. LIGHT/COLOUR OPTIMISATION Logitech RightLight technology with Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) prioritizes faces over objects and surfaces. In particular, it optimizes light balance and fine-tunes color and saturation for natural results across all skin tones. The result is a balanced image that renders participants in flattering light with reduced glare and softer shadows, even in dim or backlit conditions. ADAPTIVE PAN, TILT, AND ZOOM Whisper-quiet mechanical PTZ motor adjusts pan and tilt speed with the amount of zoom. As a result: Faster camera movement when zoomed out for quick framing and slower camera movement when zoomed in for more control.

For ceiling installations, Rally Camera detects when it’s inverted and automatically corrects the image orientation and camera controls.

So whether people are seated at a table, sitting against the wall, or walking around the room, Expansion Mic for MeetUp means everyone will be heard. Already connected on your smartphone? Dialing into an audio conference? Pair MeetUp with your smartphone or tablet to enjoy outstanding audio clarity, volume, and range that handheld devices can't match. When you need to adjust the volume, mute the microphone, or take manual control over camera position, MeetUp's remote control uses radio frequency (RF) signals for reliable and discreet control from anywhere in the room. You can even download the free Logi Remote app (available on iTunes) to control MeetUp with an iPhone or iPad. Is there no need to drill? That's OK. The optional TV Mount for MeetUp allows you to put MeetUp above or below the display without drilling new holes by attaching to the VESA mounting points behind the display. Logitech RightSense™ proactive technologies make better video meetings easy and automatic. RightSound optimizes the human voice and enhances conversational clarity, RightSight automatically moves the camera and adjusts the zoom so no one gets left out of the picture, and RightLight helps everyone look their best on camera, regardless of lighting conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
