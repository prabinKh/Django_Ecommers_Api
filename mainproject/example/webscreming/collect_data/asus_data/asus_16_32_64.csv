Tackle any enemy with an Intel® Core™ i9-12900H CPU, paired with an NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ Laptop GPU with up to a 150W max TGP. Leave loading screens behind thanks to PCIe Gen4 solid-state storage. With DDR5 memory bringing more bandwidth than ever before, the SCAR is ready to leave the competition in the dust. Get more with MUX Top-tier components require power, especially when it comes to cutting-edge GPUs. NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3070Ti Laptop GPU is fully unleashed with a max TGP of 150W, thanks to the extra 25W available with Dynamic Boost. Higher power limits unlock even more performance from these graphics cards, ensuring you have the absolute best gaming experience. Modern gaming laptops route frames from the GPU through the CPU's integrated graphics before reaching the display. This offers better battery life but prevents your GPU from giving its absolute best performance. So we're bringing a MUX switch to all 2022 ROG laptops. For competitive games, you can switch to a direct GPU mode that reduces latency and boosts performance by an average of 15%. ROG INTELLIGENT COOLING Powerful components require a robust cooling solution. The SCAR utilizes a liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU and four dedicated fan outlets to efficiently transfer heat out of the system. ROG Intelligent Cooling™ allows critical components like the CPU and GPU to maintain higher boost frequencies for longer periods of time, keeping your framerate smooth and steady even during extended gaming sessions. The 2022 Strix SCAR also upgraded to Thermal Grizzly’s Conductonaut Extreme Liquid Metal on the CPU. An ultra-high-performance thermal interface material, Conductonaut Extreme can keep these components up to 15°C cooler than traditional thermal pastes. The SCAR keeps noise in check, too: when in Performance mode, the Strix SCAR does not exceed 40 dB of noise Liquid Metal with Conductonaut Extreme Cooling is one of the greatest challenges facing gaming laptops, and ROG is constantly pushing the envelope. This drive led to liquid metals, which are extremely effective at transferring thermal energy between surfaces like a processor die and heatsink. Over a year of testing with various processors, ROG engineers observed reductions in temperatures up to 15°C with liquid metal, depending on the CPU. Lower temperatures help processors sustain higher clock speeds for longer and prevent fans from ramping up and making noise. Upgraded Arc Flow Fans™ Updated Arc Flow Fans™ feature curved blades specially shaped to maximize airflow with minimal noise. Laptop fan blades are typically the same thickness throughout, but our new design can get as thin as 0.1mm at the base before expanding toward the tip. Varying the thickness reduces turbulence as the fan blades accelerate air with centrifugal force, giving you a quieter overall experience. CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOOK Customizable Armor Caps allow you to add an extra flair to your machine. Choose from three bundled options in the box, or 3D your own with downloadable templates for a 100% unique design. The semi-translucent palm rest gives you a sneak peek at the internals, and redesigned rubber feet help to eliminate vibrations for smooth, quiet gaming sessions. Coupled with colorful accents, the sporty feel of the Strix SCAR resonates across the entire chassis. LIGHTNING-FAST, CRYSTAL CLEAR You can’t beat the enemy if you can’t see them coming. The Strix SCAR has ultra-fast panel options for every scenario, making sure you’ll never miss a moment. The 15.6” machine offers up to FHD 300Hz. With refresh rates that fast and response times of just 3ms, you can make pixel-perfect decisions even in the most frenetic firefights. Each IPS panel also offers fantastic color, Dolby Vision HDR, and Adaptive Sync for stellar gaming and viewing experience.

ROG NEBULA DISPLAY For gamers who demand the absolute best motion and image clarity, the SCAR 18 offers an incredible Nebula display with a 240Hz refresh rate, 100% DCI-P3 coverage, and a staggering 1100 nits brightness for stunning gameplay. The 18-inch, 16:10 aspect ratio 2.5K panel provides staggeringly deep blacks for content that jumps right off the screen, whether you’re watching a movie or playing a fast-moving arena shooter. SCAR 18 offers fantastic colour, Dolby Vision, Adaptive-Sync support, and an 89% screen-to-body ratio for a stellar gaming and viewing experience.  Nothing breaks in-game immersion like stuttering and tearing. GPUs render frames at variable rates, but displays usually refresh at a constant clip, so they can get out of sync, causing visible hitching and artifacts that pull you out of the action. With NVIDIA G-SYNC, the refresh rate of the display synchronizes with the GPU’s frame rate to eliminate visual tearing, minimize stuttering, and reduce input lag. Get ready to experience gameplay that looks and feels more natural than ever.  While the sRGB colour space is the standard for most digital visuals, it only represents about 75% of the DCI-P3 spectrum used for professional filmmaking. Displays with complete DCI-P3 coverage offer a wide colour gamut for more vibrant images, letting you see films and other media exactly the way they were meant to be experienced.  Each IPS-level display is factory-calibrated to ensure that colours are accurate to the Pantone® palette. Artists, designers, and content creators can add high-quality content to their portfolios and enjoy richer gaming visuals all on the same machine.  PRESS THE ATTACK The difference between victory and defeat can be separated by a single keystroke, so the SCAR 18 has a professional esports grade keyboard designed to secure the win. Built to last, the Strix SCAR's keyboard switches are rated to last over 20 million presses, and n-key rollover guarantees your system will never miss command even if you’re pressing multiple keys at once. The SCAR has a full-sized keyboard, with dedicated media controls and dedicated hotkeys that are tuned for volume and Armoury Crate controls by default, but can be customized for different functions or macros. And with per key RGB and full Aura Sync customization, the SCAR will always have the looks to match your mood.  Studio-quality Sound Dolby Atmos-powered speakers include two tweeters and two downward firing woofers to create an authentic sound stage for your games. Hi-Res audio ensures you hear your music in the same quality it was recorded. Two Way AI Noise Cancellation processes both incoming and outgoing audio to filter any errant background noises, making sure that your calls, chats and streams come through without distraction.  Two-way Ai Noise Cancelation Our advanced Two-Way AI Noise Cancellation technology runs on the CPU, which frees up the GPU to hit higher FPS. It works with any input device and also with downstream connections, letting you remove noise from both your own mic input and from incoming feeds. Noise-cancelling settings can even be customized per program, filtering specific apps like voice chat without affecting game audio you want to remain untouched.  Quad Speakers With Dolby Atmos Two tweeters and two woofers powered by Smart Amp offer richer sound with 2.8x more volume, 3x more powerful bass, and up to 3x the dynamic range of alternatives. This quad-speaker setup delivers immersive surround sound optimised by Dolby Atmos technology to deliver balanced, multidimensional audio across the full spectrum without losing clarity or detail.  All Day Endurance The Strix SCAR 18 is ready to go the distance. Featuring a 90Wh battery, the laptop can easily browse the web for hours away from the wall before needing a recharge. For flexibility on the go, USB Type-C charging is supported up to 100W. When charging using the supplied 330W power adapter, the SCAR 18 can recharge from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes.

Adaptive-Sync and 3ms response times keep motion clear, while Pantone Validation and Dolby Vision ensure you see content exactly as the creator intended. Plus, they're TUV Certified for their low blue light and flicker reduction. In other words: they're the ultimate gaming laptop displays. 12th Gen Intel Core CPU Game, Stream and create at a professional level with 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900H Cpu. These high-performance CPUs are engineered to deliver enthusiast-level gameplay in smaller, slimmer and more portable devices than ever. Clocking up to an astounding 5GHz and capable of activating 14-cores and 20-threads, gamers and creators can harness industry-leading power to blaze throught the most demanding tasks. BOOST PERFORMANCE WITH AI. NVIDIA DLSS gives games a speed boost with uncompromised image quality. Crank up the settings and resolution for an even better visual experience. MORE IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES Ray Tracing is the holy grail of graphics. It simulates how light behaves in the real-world to produce the most realistic and immersive graphics for gamers and creators - and runs fast thanks to 2nd gen RT Cores. OPTIMIZED POWER AND PERFORMANCE NVIDIA Max-Q is a suite of technologies powered by AI that optimize laptops to deliver high performance in thin form factors. MUX switch Modern gaming laptops use powerful, dedicated graphics chips for high performance—but most route those frames through the CPU's integrated graphics before reaching the display. This offers better battery life but prevents your GPU from giving its absolute best performance. So we're bringing a MUX switch to all 2022 ROG laptops. For competitive games, you can switch to a direct GPU mode that reduces latency and boosts performance by an average of 9%. Keep Your CPU Cool with liquid metal!  Liquid metal compound from thermal grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 10C compared to the standard thermal paste. Applying it onto CPUs is delicate work, so ROG commissioned custom equipment to automate the process with mechanical precision and designed a patented internal fence to contain the compound Dual Force-Canceling Woofers Woofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. In order to minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus M16 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each others’ vibrations. 3D Mic Array Three modes for the integrated microphone array give you greater control over your input. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, while minimizing input from the back, making it ideal for streaming and gaming. The stereo mode uses right and left channels to record a wider soundscape for live music or other immersive experiences. Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from all directions equally for clearer group conference calls. WiFI 6E Ultrafast WiFi 6E (802.11ax) lets you game reliably at LAN speeds wherever compatible connections are available. Network connectivity is faster and more efficient, which is especially useful in crowded spaces where traffic is high. WiFi 6E also boasts an updated Target wake Time mechanism that extends battery life and a new WPA3 Security standard that improves wireless protection.",16 inches,12th Generation,"2560 x 1600, WQXGA",Windows 11,"1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack

Contact force occurs when the bottom of the key touches the circuit board to trigger an electronic signal, which in turn generates the action appropriate to the key. To achieve the most natural feel for a keyboard, ASUS keyboard experts have scientifically determined that the optimal ergonomic click ratio for a key is between 45-60%.

ASUS ErgoSense keyboard, comfortable typing experience Your comfort is our highest priority. That’s why the ASUS ErgoSense keyboard has an incredibly satisfying feel, with the optimum key bounce and travel calculated with fine-tuned precision. Experience the ErgoSense keyboard and you’ll soon find yourself cruising effortlessly through your work.  Full-sized keyboard - 19.05 mm
The full-size 19.05 mm key pitch is the same as a desktop keyboard so you can whizz through your work with superb typing comfort and accuracy.  Dished key caps - 0.2 mm
The 0.2 mm key-cap dish is designed to match the shape of your fingertips so your fingers are gently guided to the ideal contact point with the keys.  Long key travel - 1.4 mm
The long 1.4 mm key travel lets you type without having to use too much force. And the special ASUS-designed rubber dome guarantees your click force is met with just the right tactile bump you need for a nice grip.  0.1 mm key cap relief
When fully depressed, the keys on the ErgoSense keyboard don’t sink below the level of the keyboard deck. The key caps remain at least 0.1 mm above the chassis surface, providing you with a comfortable, ergonomic typing experience. Optimal click ratio: Engineered to perfection The feel of a keyboard depends on the crucial ratio between the peak force (also known as the actuation force) and the contact force. Peak force occurs when you press down on the key and reach the maximum force that the key’s underlying rubber dome can withstand without deflecting. Contact force occurs when the bottom of the key touches the circuit board to trigger an electronic signal, which in turn generates the action appropriate to the key. To achieve the most natural feel for a keyboard, ASUS keyboard experts have scientifically determined that the optimal ergonomic click ratio for a key is between 45-60%. These forces are precisely measured and tuned using the ASUS-designed rubber domes beneath the keys.

This technology uses a denser treatment* that inhibits viruses and bacteria.

Experience the ErgoSense keyboard and you’ll soon find yourself cruising effortlessly through your work. Optimal click ratio: Engineered to perfection The feel of a keyboard depends on the crucial ratio between the peak force (also known as the actuation force) and the contact force. Peak force occurs when you press down on the key and reach the maximum force that the key’s underlying rubber dome can withstand without deflecting. Contact force occurs when the bottom of the key touches the circuit board to trigger an electronic signal, which in turn generates the action appropriate to the key. To achieve the most natural feel for a keyboard, ASUS keyboard experts have scientifically determined that the optimal ergonomic click ratio for a key is between 45-60%. These forces are precisely measured and tuned using the ASUS-designed rubber domes beneath the keys. Perfect in every detail Vivobook Go 14 keeps you fully connected with its comprehensive I/O ports. There are a USB-C® 3.2 Gen 1 port, a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a USB 2.0 port, HDMI® output and an audio combo jack — so it’s easy to connect all your existing peripherals, displays and projectors.

This 1 cm-thin, 1 kg-light marvel uses efficient 13th Gen Intel® Core™ Processors, and the amazing 13.3-inch 16:10 2.8K OLED HDR NanoEdge display delivers brilliant visuals. ASUS is completely committed to purposeful innovation that supports a healthier planet, so we've also made Zenbook S 13 OLED the most eco-friendly Zenbook ever, in line with our core values. More care, less impact!  True-to-life 13.3” 2.8K OLED Display 2880 by 1800 resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio, 0.2 ms response time, 550 nits peak brightness, 100% DCI-P3 color gamut  All-around sustainable design Post-industrial recycled (PIR), Post-consumer recycled (PCR), and Ocean-bound materials, eco-friendly plasma ceramic aluminum, FSC™ Mix-certified packaging The laptop that moves with you! Topping the scales at a mere 1 kg, you can see we’ve made an extra effort to make Zenbook S 13 OLED the perfect size for your on-the-move lifestyle. To keep it compact, we use CNC machining to make the most efficient use of the available space for components. Its side profile measures just 1 cm — that’s about as slim as a pen!  “It feels like nothing else. It always looks like new.” The color, shades, porosity, and texture are further fine-tuned using temperature and electricity. Incredibly, this makes each lid individually unique. No two are alike! And even better, the alloy will ensure that the laptop’s unique look will last for its entire lifetime. “Minimum eco impact, maximum practicality” Plasma ceramic aluminum components are also fully recyclable at the end of their life span. The resulting corrosion protection is imparted by changes to the substrate itself, rather than by adding sprayed-on coatings that may be difficult to recycle.  50%+ lower carbon footprint Natural elements have long inspired the design and craftsmanship of the Zenbook series. To do our part to protect the fundamental sources of our inspiration, ASUS is committed to do more with less through Zenbook. We try to mitigate its carbon footprint by incorporating recycled materials and designing more eco-conscious packaging. In addition, Zenbook S 13 OLED exceeds the ENERGY STAR® energy efficiency standard by 43% to reduce its electricity consumption. Via these sustainable actions, the overarching goal of this device’s sustainability initiatives is to achieve carbon neutrality.  More Power, Less Limits We’ve packed a Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 processor into the superlight chassis, so Zenbook S 13 OLED delivers premium mobile performance for any task. It’s also an Intel® Evo™ Edition laptop with instant wake-up, a faster WiFi connection, and high battery efficiency to keep you productive throughout your day. Immerse in your favorite entertainment Enjoy your favorite entertainment with breathtakingly realistic sounds that move around you. Zenbook S 13 OLED has a Dolby Atmos® stereo sound system that’s also Harman Kardon certified, with a Smart Amplifier that can boosts the volume up to 3.5x louder than a standard amplifier.  More Connectivity, Less Hassle Although Zenbook S 13 OLED is unbelievably compact, it packs in all the connections you need. The two ultrafast Thunderbolt™ 4 USB-C® ports support fast charging, 4K external displays, and up to 40 Gbps data transfers. From dawn to dusk There’s no need to panic if power outlets are in short supply: Zenbook S 13 OLED’s long-lasting 63 Wh battery can keep you productive for longer. And when it’s time to charge, there’s no need to stop — with fast charging you can quickly top it up.

This 1 cm-thin 1 kg-light marvel uses efficient 13th Gen Intel® Core™ Processors, and the amazing 13.3-inch 16:10 2.8K OLED HDR NanoEdge display delivers brilliant visuals. ASUS is completely committed to purposeful innovation that supports a healthier planet, so we've also made Zenbook S 13 OLED the most eco-friendly Zenbook ever, in line with our core values.

Topping the scales at a mere 1 kg, you can see we’ve made an extra effort to make Zenbook S 13 OLED the perfect size for your on-the-move lifestyle. To keep it compact, we use CNC machining to make the most efficient use of the available space for components. Its side profile measures just 1 cm — that’s about as slim as a pen! The best materials With the durability of metal and the lightness of plastic, magnesium-aluminum alloy is used for the keyboard deck, forming a tough structure that doesn’t need any extra support. An extremely thin glass covering is used for the touchpad, for an ultra-smooth navigation experience. Contemporary silhouette Minimalist style is an important part of the Zenbook design language, with clean lines and a svelte silhouette that turn heads. It's an ultraportable that reflects the pure design philosophy of modern minimalism. Pioneering sustainability For the first time, we used a special process to transform the aluminum lid into a plasma ceramic aluminum exclusive to ASUS. This process uses pure water, and no organic compounds, strong acids, or heavy metals are required. Instead, this environmentally low-impact bath-based method produces a physical and chemical transformation of the aluminum. This results in increased wear resistance, corrosion protection, thermal management, hardness, and lifespan. “It feels like nothing else. It always looks like new.” The color, shades, porosity, and texture are further fine-tuned using temperature and electricity. Incredibly, this makes each lid individually unique. No two are alike! And even better, the alloy will ensure that the laptop’s unique look will last for its entire lifetime. More Power, Less Limits We’ve packed a 13th Gen Intel® Core™ i5 Processor into the superlight chassis, so Zenbook S 13 OLED delivers premium mobile performance for any task. It’s also an Intel® Evo™ laptop with instant wake-up, a faster WiFi connection, and high battery efficiency to keep you productive throughout your day.
