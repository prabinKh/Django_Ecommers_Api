Still first in fast: Dell's newest 15"" M-Series gaming laptop with a 240Hz display is the Alienware m15 R6. The astoundingly quick refresh rate guarantees fluid gameplay and outstanding visual performance.

Crystal-clear action: Whether you're gaming at your leisure or in the thick of battle, never miss any critical details thanks to smoother gameplay. The newest m15 is exceptionally quick, with a refresh rate of 240Hz, thanks to Dell's purposeful engineering decisions. But Dell didn't stop there. The newest m15 R6 provides smoother gameplay during high-speed action owing to NVIDIA® G-SYNC® technology, which synchronizes your display's refresh rate with the performance of your graphics card.

Give your eyes a break: The m15 R6 display option has Dell's ComfortView Plus low blue light technology. This is a hardware-based technique of filtering blue light without compromising image quality, meant to keep you engaged in the game for hours on end.  SATISFY YOUR NEED FOR SPEED The Alienware m15 R6 is designed to be versatile. Whatever your gaming requirements are, this laptop will not only fulfill them but will also exceed them by increasing the bar for display technologies.

Fast is a given: The latest m15 R6 comes with an impressively fast refresh rate of 240Hz and QHD resolution for brilliant visuals and unforgettable gaming experiences every time.

Uninterrupted gaming: The goal was speed, and the result was improved gaming. A 240Hz option boosts the resolution to QHD, which means nearly double the number of pixels as an FHD display at an extremely rapid refresh rate to ensure your games appear sharp and feel smooth. Dell’s fastest refresh rate: Dell didn’t stop until they accomplished the previously impossible. Experience Dell's fastest display option on a 15” gaming laptop, now set at 240Hz. Available in QHD resolution, it’s the perfect refresh rate for competitive gameplay where your reflexes can keep up with high-speed action thanks to smoother graphics – the ultimate choice for the ultimate win.

Smoother support: With smooth gameplay in mind, the 240Hz panel options also feature NVIDIA® G-SYNC® technology, which allows for a stronger handshake between your display's refresh rate and the refresh rate that your GPU is capable of producing. ADVANCED THERMAL ENGINEERING: Design, according to Dell, is more than simply mechanics — it is art. Alienware Cryo-Tech Cooling Technology is an engineering solution that, rather than compromising your system's gaming performance through electrical and mechanical ways, preserves your system's stability even during the most intensive gaming moments.

Airflow at its finest: The Alienware m15 R6 chassis from Dell prioritizes performance with a twin fan design that draws cold air in from the top and bottom vents and exhales exhaust through the left, right, and rear vents for optimal cooling of the main components.

Consider your thermals managed: If you want to directly control your system temperatures, you can now alter your CPU's maximum temperature limit by modifying a BIOS setting called TCC Offset. Apart from that, gamers may alter their power settings across one of five distinct fan profiles in our Alienware Command Center software to favor performance or battery life, with other options in between.

Load balancing heat pipes: Thermal activity across important components such as the GPU and CPU are intelligently discharged over four copper composite heat pipes with diameters of up to 3mm.

High voltage driving fan: The fire-resistant, liquid crystal polymer fan blades use sleeve bearings and three-phase fan control to reduce friction and efficiently circulate air. POWER PRIORITIZED Power up the action: The new Alienware m15 R6 is ready to take you to new gaming heights, with 11th Gen Intel® Core processors offering up to 8-cores and 16-threads of multi-threaded performance.

Prepare for the win: With the NVIDIA® GeForce RTX 3070 graphics, every mission becomes an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities. NVIDIA's 3rd-Gen Max-Q technologies are included with the Alienware m15 R6, including support for Dynamic Boost 2.0 for additional graphics power, Resizable BAR for improved CPU to GPU processing, and Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology, which uses AI to boost your frame rates when your graphics card is working the hardest. The m15 R6 is capable of 125W of maximum graphics power when equipped with NVIDIA® GeForce RTX 3070 with Dynamic Boost 2.0.

Loaded with memory: The Alienware m15 R6 introduces DDR4 3200Mhz memory to the m15 15"" laptops, taking your mega-tasking abilities to a new level. It even lets gamers upgrade their memory post-purchase, using the two available SO-DIMM slots.

High-speed attack: Killer DoubleShot™ Pro allows the use of both the Killer Wireless and Killer Ethernet interfaces at the same time. This will provide more usable bandwidth to the end-user. Killer E2600 1G Ethernet is capable of handling 1 Gbps of traffic and the Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 is capable of handling up to 2.4 Gbps of traffic. Killer DoubleShot Pro allows both of these interfaces to work at the same time which will give the end-user max throughput as high as 3.4 Gbps. LET YOUR LIGHTS SHINE AlienFX allows you to customize your game experience. With dynamic lighting effects and a wide RGB spectrum to pick from, its fully configurable lighting system is designed to bring you closer to the worlds you play in. HORIZON SLIM BACKPACK! The Dell Alienware M15 R6 Comes with the all rugged Alienware Horizon Slim Backpack! With the Alienware Horizon Slim Backpack, you can revel in the glory of 360° protection. It is designed with high materials and impact resistant protection to accommodate up to a 17"" Alienware laptop.   ","3 Type-A USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports (one with PowerShare)
